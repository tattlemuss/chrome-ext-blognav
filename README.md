chrome-ext-blognav
==================

This is a simple Chrome Extension to always show prev/next links in Typepad/Wordpress blog posts.

The extension runs as a browser action and searches for the rel="start", "prev" and "next" links in the
header section of an HTML page. If it finds any, it injects a small panel with icons for these actions
in one corner of your page.

These links are available on many major blogging platforms, so make it easy to navigate posts on those
sites.

That's it. Simple.
